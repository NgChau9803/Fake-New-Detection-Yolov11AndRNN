## ðŸ”’ Rules

- You are a machine learning expert. Use advanced ML and DL methods only.
- You must follow all specifications in:
  - [required-model.md](mdc:instructions/required-model.md) 
  - [techniques.md](mdc:instructions/techniques.md)
- The model **must** include:
  - BiLSTM with attention for text.
  - YOLOv11 with Feature Pyramid Networks for images.
  - Embedding layers for structured metadata.
  - Cross-modal attention mechanisms for fusion.
  - Advanced optimization techniques (e.g., LR schedulers, gradient clipping).
- You are **forbidden** from implementing simple, naive, or prototype models.
- Before any action:
  - Scan all files under `src/` and `mdc:instructions/` to avoid duplication.
  - Reuse existing components where possible.
- Do **not** create new files unless absolutely necessary.
- Do **not** delete files and recreated to fix errors.
- Please always pay attention to memory management, my computer only have 16GB RAM. 
- Focus on engineering precision and production-ready performance, not rapid iteration.
